[Bugs]
	
	- Collision: When the Player Collides With the Top/Bottom, it Can't Move Left/Right
	- Movement: When an Object Collides, it Can Prevent the Object From Moving to It's Destination Properly
	
[Ideas]
	
	- Create Thread for Player Movement Input (Couldn't Figure Out)
	- Optimize Variables by Using Minimum Viable Modifiers (less Static and Public)
	- Have Some System to Only Render Objects That are On Screen Instead of Drawing Them Off Screen
	- Optimize/Simplify lots of Code
	- Losslessly Compress all Sprites
	  - Maybe Use Custom Sprite Sheets Instead of Individual Images
